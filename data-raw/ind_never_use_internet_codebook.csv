It may also be used in case of experimental data (e.g. in the context of a pilot ahead of a full scale production process) or in case of data of (anticipated/assessed) low quality. If needed, additional information can be provided through free text using the COMMENT_OBS attribute at the observation level or at a higher level. This code is to be used when the estimation is done by a sender agency. When the imputation is carried out by a receiver agency in order to replace or fill gaps in reported data series, the flag to use is I “Value imputed by a receiving agency”."
