Description: The goal of dataobservatory is to facilitate 
     the automated documentation, and the automated recording of descriptive 
     (DataCite and Dublin Core) and administrative (statistical processing SXDX) 
     metadata for datasets. It also helps recording information about the 
     computational environment to increase reproducability.
